\chapter{Results}

In this chapter we present the results of the data collection heuristic
proposed in chapter~3. The heuristic used for simulation, as stated 
earlier, ignores $t_{LS}$ and $t_{MBS}$. %what are these quantities?
%% The intro to chater must tell the reader what to expect in chapter.
%% But the summary here start abruptly. How simulation is planned?
%% No mention about the parameters of simulation or how realistic their
%% choices are.

We now present simulation results of our heuristic applied on the following cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Field size 1000m $\times$ 1000m
\item Sensor Range: 50 m
\item Number of sensors: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
\end{itemize}
