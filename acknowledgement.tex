I would like to express my deepest gratitude towards my thesis supervisors Dr. R.K. Ghosh and Dr. Maitreya Natu. They have guided me, remained very patient and have given valuable suggestions throughout my thesis work. I would like to thank Dr. Vaishali Sadaphal of TCS, TRDDC, Pune for valuable insights into the initial stages of the problem and help in systematizing my approach to the same. I am also indebted to TCS, TRDDC Pune for giving me the opprtunity to meet Dr. Natu and Dr. Sadaphal and work with them as a paid intern. Finally, I am in deep gratitude of my family for being a constant source of support and care and taking great pains for it.
